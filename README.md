# PPKM_sentiment_analysis_using_NLP

Sentiment analysis can help identify different views and feelings among various groups of people toward PPKM policies.
People can feel a range of emotions from full support, to dissatisfaction, to fear, to indifference.
Knowing this sentiment is very important for the government and policy makers to understand the level of acceptance and effectiveness of this policy, so as to increase the response and adjustment if necessary

Overall, the use of NLP models to analyze PPKM sentiments can provide important benefits in understanding public perceptions and provide valuable insights for decision-making and management of health and social crises during PPKM.
In the data preparation phase, I perform cleanup and preprocessing of the text, including tokenization, removal of stopwords, and stemming.
Next, I divide the data into training datasets and test datasets to train and evaluate the model.
The results of the model evaluation show the accuracy of the model including goodfit at 78% and validation at 76%.
However, it should be noted that the accuracy of the model can depend on the quality and amount of training data used. Collection and processing of more representative and comprehensive data can improve model performance for more accurate sentiment analysis.
